**9.0 (2016-08-25)**

- I am finally satisfied with callback query handling. Many styles of dealing with
callback query are now possible.

- Added a few pair producers, e.g. `pave_event_space()`, `pave_callback_query_origin_map()`
- Added `Bot.Scheduler` to schedule internal events
- Invented a standard event format for delegates to create their own events easily
- Improved Mixin framework. Added `StandardEventMixin`, `IdleTerminateMixin`, and
`InterceptCallbackQueryMixin`.
- Added `CallbackQueryOriginHandler`
- Revamped `Listener` and message capture specifications
- Default `retries=3` for `urllib3`

- Added `enable_callback_query` parameter to `*Handler` constructors
- Added default `on_timeout` method to `@openable` decorator
- Added `IdleTerminate` and `AbsentCallbackQuery` as subclasses of `WaitTooLong` to distinguish between different timeout situations
- Revamped `Listener` to handle different timeout requirements
